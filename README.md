# 🎯 Key Analytical Questions :

This analysis focused on solving critical business puzzles:

1. **Revenue Contribution:** What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers? (Q1)

2. **Subscriber Value:** Do subscribed customers spend more? (Q5)

3. **Loyalty Segmentation:** How do we segment customers (New, Returning, Loyal) based on purchase history? (Q7)

4. **Discount Efficiency:** Which high-value customers use discounts but still spend above the average purchase amount? (Q2)

5. **Product Demand:** Which are the top 3 most purchased products within each category? (Q8)

# 📈 Major Findings & Business Insights :

1. The Power of Subscribers and Repeat Buyers.
- **High Value:** Subscribed customers were found to generate significantly higher average spend and total revenue than non-subscribers.
- **Loyalty Correlation:** There is a strong correlation between being a repeat buyer (5+ previous purchases) and having a subscription.
- **Actionable Takeaway:** Incentivize the "Returning" customer segment (Q7) to move them toward "Loyal" status, as this group is highly likely to subscribe and dramatically increase their value (Q9).

2. Demographic and Product Focus.
- **Gender:** Female customers generated a greater share of the total revenue contribution (Q1).
- **Age Groups:** The 25-35 and 45-55 age groups are the top revenue drivers (Q10).
- **Top Products:** The analysis identified the top 5 products with the highest average review ratings (Q3) and the top 3 sellers per category (Q8), providing a clear list for inventory prioritization.

3. Smart Discounting Strategy.
- The analysis successfully isolated customers who respond to discounts but still spend high amounts (Q2).
- **Actionable Takeaway:** Move away from generic, site-wide discounts. Instead, use promotions as a targeted tool to retain high-value shoppers who are likely to spend regardless, protecting the overall profit margin.

# 🚀 Conclusion and Next Steps :

- This project provided a robust, data-driven foundation for marketing strategy. The insights are directly applicable to optimizing marketing spend, personalizing email campaigns, and improving inventory management.
- **Next Steps:** Implement a predictive classification model to forecast which non-subscribed customers are most likely to convert, allowing for a highly efficient subscription marketing push.
